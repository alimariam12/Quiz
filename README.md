# University of Minnesota Coding Bookcamp
## Homework #4: Code Quiz

### Task

We were challenged to make a Code Quiz making our own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is our first assignment where we weren't given any file and it was pretty hard. It is also important to learn because it'll give us practice for the real world interviews.


### Installation
  For this assignment you will need:
  - A new repository for the assignment and clone to repository `git@github.com:alimariam12/Quiz.git` to the terminal.
  - Visual Studio Code: after downloading the homework to the appropriate folder, use command `code .` to get to VSC. 

### Usage
